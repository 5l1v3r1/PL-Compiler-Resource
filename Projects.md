## Compilers

1. [LLVM](http://llvm.org/)

The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.

2. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom.

3. [OpenArkCompiler](https://gitee.com/harmonyos/OpenArkCompiler)

OpenArkCompiler是来自华为方舟编译器的开源项目。

## Runtime && VM

1. [OMR](https://github.com/eclipse/omr)

The Eclipse OMR project is a set of open source C and C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes that support many different hardware and operating system platforms.

## Tools

1. [screader](https://github.com/shining1984/screader)

The screader is a soure code reading tool based the libclang. It is implemented by the C. The screader can work on the clang-10.0.0 now.

2. [clang-tutor](https://github.com/banach-space/clang-tutor)

clang-tutor is a collection of self-contained reference Clang plugins. It's a tutorial that targets novice and aspiring Clang developers.

3. [Redex](https://fbredex.com/)

ReDex is an Android bytecode (dex) optimizer originally developed at Facebook. It provides a framework for reading, writing, and analyzing .dex files, and a set of optimization passes that use this framework to improve the bytecode. An APK optimized by ReDex should be smaller and faster than its source.

4. [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)

Pyright is a fast type checker meant for large Python source bases. It can run in a “watch” mode and performs fast incremental updates when files are modified.

5. [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes)

Ripes is a visual computer architecture simulator and assembly code editor built for the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
